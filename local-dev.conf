[spawner]
# For scalability, worker containers can run on separate physical hosts. At least one
# spawner and one health check worker should be launched on each worker host, and the
# host_id should be the unique for each worker host.

# An addressable IP for the spawner's host. This config is not currently used but could
# be at a future date to support a conatiner scheduler like swarm or mesos.
host_ip: 172.17.0.1

# When new workers are spawned, a config file must be mounted for communication with rabbit and redis.
# This path should be an absolute path *on the host* where such a config file exists. By default, spawners
# read this path from an environment variable, abaco_conf_host_path, but if this variable isn't set spawners
# will fall back to using this configuration.

# alive indefinitely.
